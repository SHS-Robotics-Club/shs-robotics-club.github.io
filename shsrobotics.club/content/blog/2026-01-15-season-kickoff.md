The 2022-2023 FTC PowerPlay season is here! Our team gathered to watch the game reveal and start brainstorming our robot design.

## About PowerPlay

In this season, robots score points by:
- Placing cones on junction tiles
- Parking on the charging station
- Completing autonomous and driver-controlled tasks

## Our Initial Concepts

1. **4-bar linkage intake** for picking up cones
2. **Sliding elevator** for reaching different junction heights
3. **Tank vs mecanum drive** - still deciding

The team spent the afternoon brainstorming and sketching initial ideas. We'll begin CAD work next week!
