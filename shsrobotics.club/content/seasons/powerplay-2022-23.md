## Season Summary

Starting off this year, we transitioned from our old build system (Tetrix) to GoBilda. We did this for a number of reasons but it really boils down to better tolerances, and much better ease of use for general mechanisms.

## Robot Design

Our bot consists of multiple sub-assemblies and sensors:

- **Drive-train (DT)**: The main chassis of the bot
- **Drive Belts**: Connects the wheels to the motors
- **Odometry Pods**: Used for tracking the position of the bot reliably
- **Lift System**: 5 stages of Misumi linear slides driven by continuous string
- **MGN12 Rail**: Separate lift stage that the claw is mounted to
- **Magnetic Gearbox**: Used for managing the MGN12 rail
- **Claw**: Used to grab game elements

## Drivetrain

We utilize a four-motor, belt-driven mecanum drivetrain, powered by 312 rpm GoBilda motors, with a 2:3 gear ratio on the belts. This configuration allows for increased speed and quick maneuvering, while maintaining silent and efficient operation. Coupled with our three dead wheel odometry system, our drivetrain provides accurate positioning during matches.

## Lift

We opted to use 5 stages of Misumi linear slides driven by a continuous string wound on a spool. We use a combination of two strings on each side of the lift; one to control extension, and the other to retract. This use of double stringing ensures accurate positioning.

## Competition Results

- **Scrimmage**: Exceeded expectations, basic claw and autonomous
- **League Meet 1**: Learned about time management, designed slide inserts
- **League Meet 3**: Added retract strings, lift sorted out
- **Gulf Coast League Tournament**: Selected as finalist alliance, gearbox issues in finals

## Awards

- **Finalist Alliance** - FL Gulf Coast League Tournament
- **Motivate Award 3rd Place** - FL Gulf Coast League Tournament  
- **Innovate Award** - Florida Championship
- **Finalist Alliance 2nd Pick** - Florida Championship

## Outreach

We participated in various events including Anona Elementary's Science Night, Largo Playcon, and STEM Explorer Fest. We also mentored Team 22532 The Phantom Menaces and our sister team 3736 Serious Business.
